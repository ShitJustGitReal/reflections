1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Well, an online backup never hurts.
- And of course to be able to work on the project from different machines.
- But most of all: to work on the project with other collaborators.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe your local changes or the changes done to remote aren't finished yet.  You don't want to share crap or lure crap in.
And maybe you aren't satisfied with the way the remote project is going, and want to go your own way with it. Or you haven't been to the project for a long time, and want to check compatibility first.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are for copying projects from GH you want to work on with other collaborators.
- I will never use a direct clone of someone else's GH project again because it is not open source. Well, maybe if I just wanted to try something. But not when I'm seriously putting an effort into it.
- Branches are for developing new features or making separate sideprojects WITHIN a fork or clone.  

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We want to make sure our new features and/or improvements and those done to the remote stay compatible with each other. When stored locally, we can diffcheck the latest code of the remote with our version, and resolve possible conflicts. 

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using a diffchecker, a directory somewhere in the cloud, plus an extensive readme file would make the project's administration much less time consuming at first. 

But after a while, things will probably get messy:
- We will only have the latest version (or numerous numbered versions of files)
- We would not be able to look back what we did when and why.
- We would not have clear branches.
- We would not be able to collaborate with multiple people easily.
- We would not be able to share our code easily with other people interested in what we are doing.
